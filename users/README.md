First application part of graghql

to start run 

<mark>npm run dev</mark>

in one terminal and then

npm run json:server

in another.

npm run dev will work on http://localhost:4000/graphql
npm run json:server will run on http://localhost:3000/users

in this project we are keeping a db of users.

We first used queries to get specific users and companies.
We then added mutations to allow to add users, delete users and edit users.
